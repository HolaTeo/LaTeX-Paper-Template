# LaTeX Paper Template

If you didn't install LaTeX or this is your first time to use LaTeX, go [here](http://stom.chkwon.net/resources/computer-help/latex/) for some guidelines.

Download [this zip file](https://github.com/chkwon/LaTeX-Paper-Template/archive/master.zip) that contains all files.

Read and compare `template.tex` and [`template.pdf`](https://github.com/chkwon/LaTeX-Paper-Template/blob/master/template.pdf).


# Presentation Slides

For presentation slides, [`beamer`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beamer_(LaTeX)) is recommended. I create a template using colors and logos of the University at Buffalo. Check https://github.com/chkwon/UB_Beamer_Template. For the University of South Florida, check https://github.com/chkwon/USF_Beamer_Template.
