	Our models adjust for user fatigue through an exponential tilt to
	the first-view CTR (probability of click on first article exposure)
	that is based only on user-specific repeat-exposure features. We
	illustrate our approach on data obtained from a module (Today Module)
	published regularly on Yahoo! Front Page and demonstrate significant
	improvement over commonly used baseline methods. Large scale simulation
	experiments to study the performance of our models under different
	scenarios provide encouraging results. Throughout, all modeling assumptions

	Abstract = {{In this paper, we study dynamic shortest path problems that determine
	a shortest path from a specified source node to every other node
	in the network where arc travel times change dynamically. We consider
	two problems: the minimum-time walk problem and the minimum-cost
	walk problem. The minimum-time walk problem is to find a walk with
	the minimum travel time. The minimum-cost walk problem is to find
	a walk with the minimum weighted sum of the travel time and the excess
	travel time (over the minimum possible travel time). The minimum-time
	walk problem is known to be polynomially solvable for a class of
	networks called FIFO networks. In this paper, (i) we show that the
	minimum-cost walk problem is an NP-hard problem; (ii) we develop
	a pseudopolynomial-time algorithm to solve the minimum-cost walk
	problem (for integer travel times); and (iii) we develop a polynomial-time
	algorithm for the minimum-time walk problem arising in road networks
	with traffic lights. {\copyright} 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

	We start by analyzing the effects of a weather system on a vehicle

	attributes of a link due to movement of the weather systems. This
	analysis is used as a building block for the problem of finding a
	least risk path for hazmat transportation on a network exposed to
	such weather systems. Several methods are offered to solve the underlying
	problem, and computational results are reported. We draw two conclusions
	from this paper. First, it is possible to determine the time-dependent
	attributes for links on a network provided that some assumptions
	on the nature of the weather system are made. Second, heuristics
	can provide effective solutions for practical size problems while
	allowing for parking the vehicle to avoid weather system effects.}},

	two distinct linear maxmin programming problems. There is a simple

	In that sense, the reformulations do not introduce additional complexity.
	Necessary optimality conditions (complementarity and monotonicity)
	of both reformulations are used to obtain a finitely convergent and

	Abstract = {{In this paper, we apply the stochastic dynamic programming to find
	the dynamic shortest path from the source node to the sink node in
	stochastic dynamic networks, in which the arc lengths are independent
	random variables with exponential distributions. In each node there
	is an environmental variable, which evolves in accordance with a
	continuous time Markov process. The parameter of the exponential
	distribution of the transition time of each arc is also a function
	of the state of the environmental variable of its initiative node.
	Upon arriving at each node, we can move toward the sink node through
	the best outgoing arc or wait. At the beginning, it is assumed that
	upon arriving at each node, we know the state of its environmental
	variable and also the states of the environmental variables of its
	adjacent nodes. Then we extend this assumption such that upon arriving
	at each node, we know the states of the environmental variables of
	all nodes. In the ship routing problem, which we focus in this paper,
	the environmental variables of all nodes are known, but it is shown

	Abstract = {{Previous work on the risk-averse routing of hazardous materials has
	focused on ways of finding a single safest route between a pair of
	points. For repeated shipments where there is complete uncertainty
	about link incident probabilities, it is shown that the safest strategy
	is in general to use a mix of routes. Starting with a simple two-route
	example, it is shown that maximum exposure can be significantly reduced
	by sharing shipments between routes. In order to determine the safest
	set of routes and the safest share of traffic between these routes,
	a minmax problem is formulated which considers both the loss in the
	event of an incident and shipment (travel) cost. Connections to game
	theory provide useful insights into the nature of the solution. The
	properties of the optimality conditions are explored leading to the
	formulation of an equivalent linear programming problem.}},

	we approximate the problem of optimization of VaR, a widely used
	downside risk measure by introducing four approximating models that
	origininate in robust optimization. We show that all four models
	allow the flexibility of adjusting the level of conservativism such
	that the probability of the actual cost being less than a specified
	level, in the worst case distribution, is at least 1 ‚{\`a}{\'\i}

	we propose a Frank-Wolfe type algorithm that we show converges to

	more conservative than the ellipsoidal uncertainty set model and
	show that we can reduce the robust model to solving a polynomial
	number of nominal problems. We generalize our earlier proposed framework

	Abstract = {{This article introduces a game-theoretic approach for allocating
	protection resources among the components of a network so as to maximize
	its robustness to external disruptions. Specifically, we consider
	shortest-path networks where disruptions may result in traffic flow
	delays through the affected components or even in the complete loss
	of some elements. A multilevel program is proposed to identify the
	set of components to harden so as to minimize the length of the shortest
	path between a supply node and a demand node after a worst-case disruption
	of some unprotected components. An implicit enumeration algorithm
	is then developed to solve the multilevel problem to optimality.
	The approach is streamlined by solving the lower-level interdiction
	problem heuristically at each node of an enumeration tree and by
	using some variable fixing rules to reduce the dimension of the lower-level
	problems. A thorough computational investigation demonstrates that
	the proposed solution method is able to identify optimal protection
	strategies for networks of significant size. The paper is concluded
	with a study of the sensitivity of the solution approach to variations

	It proposes a branch-and-bound algorithm that uses a Lagrangian relaxation
	to obtain lower and upper bounds at the nodes of the tree. The Lagrangian
	function exploits the structure of the problem and can be decomposed
	into smaller subproblems that can be solved efficiently. In addition,
	some reduction procedures based on the Lagrangian bounds are implemented.
	These yield a considerable reduction of the size of the problem and

	for a given query. A key advantage of the model is its ability to
	retrieve relevant documents that have not yet been clicked for that
	query and rank those effectively. We conduct experiments on click
	logs from image search, comparing our ("backward") random walk model
	to a different ("forward") random walk, varying parameters such as
	walk length and self-transition probability. The most effective combination
	is a long backward walk with high self-transition probability.}},

	Abstract = {{Click-through rates are still the de facto measure of Internet advertising
	effectiveness. Unfortunately, click-through rates have plummeted.
	This decline prompts two critical questions: (1) Why do banner ads
	seem to be ineffective and (2) what can advertisers do to improve
	their effectiveness? To address these questions, we utilized an eye-tracking
	device to investigate online surfers' attention to online advertising.
	Then we conducted a large-scale survey of Internet users' recall,
	recognition, and awareness of banner advertising. Our research suggests
	that the reason why click-through rates are low is that surfers actually
	avoid looking at banner ads during their online activities. This
	implies that the larger part of a surfer's processing of banners
	will probably be done at the pre-attentive level. If such is the
	case, click-through rate is an ineffective measure of banner ad performance.
	Our research also shows that banner ads do have an impact on traditional
	memory-based measure of effectiveness. Thus, we claim that advertisers
	should rely more on traditional brand equity measures such as brand
	awareness and advertising recall. Using such measures, we show that
	repetition affects unaided advertising recall, brand recognition,
	and brand awareness and that a banner's message influences both aided
	advertising recall and brand recognition.}},

	Abstract = {{This paper considers the sale of a seasonal product in the face of
	strategic customers. At the beginning of the selling season, the
	retailer announces both the price ph at which the product will be
	sold during the selling season and the post-season clearance price
	p<ph for unsold items. We analyze two operating regimes: The ‚{\"A}?
	no reservation regime‚{\"A}? allows a buyer either to purchase
	the product at price ph when he arrives or to enter a lottery to
	purchase at price p if the product remains unsold. The ‚{\"A}?
	reservation regime‚{\"A}? offers each buyer one extra option than
	the no reservation regime: reserve the product for purchase at the
	clearance price p. If the buyer reserves the product under the reservation
	regime and if it remains unsold at the end of the selling season,
	then he is obligated to purchase it at price p. We consider a situation
	in which heterogeneous customers with probabilistic valuation arrive
	in accord with a Poisson process. We characterize the rational purchasing
	behavior wherein each arriving customer is strategic; each customer
	takes other customers' purchasing behavior into consideration. By
	considering the Nash equilibrium of this game, we show that strategic
	customer behavior can render the customer to be worse off and the
	retailer to be better off under the reservation regime, despite the
	fact that this regime offers one extra option (reservation) to a
	customer. Hence, more purchasing options do not necessarily benefit

	Abstract = {{The most-widely used definition of risk in the hazardous materials
	transportation literature is the expected consequence of an incident
	(accident resulting in a release), which, for each edge of the network,
	is equal to the product of the incident probability and a quantifiable
	consequence (such as number of people evacuated). This definition
	ignores the risk-averse attitudes of many decision-makers when dealing
	with low probability/high consequence events. We suggest that avoiding
	a catastrophe (an incident with a very large consequence) may be
	a relevant issue in routing hazardous materials, and we introduce
	three different catastrophe-avoidance models. In the first model,
	catastrophe avoidance is achieved by minimizing the maximum population
	exposure. In the second model, the variance of the route consequence
	is incorporated into the decision. In the third model, an explicit
	disutility function is used. We show that all three models reduce
	to a standard shortest path problem. Each model avoids high-population
	areas of the transport network. We give numerical examples and discuss
	the similarities and the differences among the three models. The
	first of the three models suggested may be the most intuitive, and
	is the most tractable computationally. Implementation of the other
	two models may be difficult due to scaling issues. Nevertheless,
	these models offer theoretical insight that may be valuable to researchers.}},

@article{Friesz2011trb,
	Abstract = {{In this paper we present a dual-time-scale formulation of dynamic
	user equilibrium (DUE) with demand evolution. Our formulation belongs
	to the problem class that Pang and Stewart (2008) refer to as differential
	variational inequalities. It combines the within-day time scale for
	which route and departure time choices fluctuate in continuous time
	with the day-to-day time scale for which demand evolves in discrete
	time steps. Our formulation is consistent with the often told story
	that drivers adjust their travel demands at the end of every day
	based on their congestion experience during one or more previous
	days. We show that analysis of the within-day assignment model is
	tremendously simplified by expressing dynamic user equilibrium as
	a differential variational inequality. We also show there is a class
	of day-to-day demand growth models that allow the dual-time-scale
	formulation to be decomposed by time-stepping to yield a sequence
	of continuous time, single-day, dynamic user equilibrium problems.
	To solve the single-day DUE problems arising during time-stepping,
	it is necessary to repeatedly solve a dynamic network loading problem.
	We observe that the network loading phase of DUE computation generally
	constitutes a differential algebraic equation (DAE) system, and we
	show that the DAE system for network loading based on the link delay
	model (LDM) of Friesz et al. (1993) may be approximated by a system
	of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). That system of ODEs, as
	we demonstrate, may be efficiently solved using traditional numerical
	methods for such problems. To compute an actual dynamic user equilibrium,
	we introduce a continuous time fixed-point algorithm and prove its
	convergence for effective path delay operators that allow a limited
	type of nonmonotone path delay. We show that our DUE algorithm is
	compatible with network loading based on the LDM and the cell transmission
	model (CTM) due to Daganzo (1995). We provide a numerical example
	based on the much studied Sioux Falls network.}},

	Abstract = {{A flexible product is a menu of two or more alternative, typically
	substitute, products offered by a constrained supplier using a sales
	or booking process. The supplier reserves the right to assign customers
	who purchase a flexible product to one of the alternatives at a time
	near the end of the booking process. An example would be an airline
	offering a morning flight consisting of specific flights serving
	the same market. Flexible products are currently offered by a number
	of industries including air cargo, tour operators, and Internet advertising.
	Flexible products have the advantage of increasing overall demand
	and enabling better capacity utilization at the cost of potentially
	cannibalizing high-fare demand for specific products. This paper
	introduces the concept of flexible products and derives conditions
	and algorithms for the management of a single flexible product consisting
	of two specific products. We use numerical simulation to illustrate
	the benefits from offering flexible products and discuss extension
	of the approach to more general settings.}},

	Abstract = {{Most airlines have developed very complex and diverse fare structures.
	The objective of the Yield management (YM) problem is to allocate
	capacity to the different fare classes so that the airline's revenue
	is maximized. In this thesis, both the YM problem for passengers
	and the YM problem for cargo are considered. In the passenger problem,
	customers arrive during the booking period prior to the departure
	date. Each customer specifies an itinerary and a fare class. The
	carrier can either accept or reject the customer and must make this
	decision in a matter of seconds. The distribution of customer arrivals
	is known both as a function of time and of fare class. The cargo
	problem is similar to the passenger problem. However, rather than
	a complete itinerary and a far class, each customer specifies an
	origin and destination station, several cargo characteristics, and
	a price. Hence, the carrier must also find a route with available
	capacity if an order is accepted. The distribution of customer arrivals
	is known both as a function of time and of customer type. In the
	first part of this thesis existing approaches to the passenger problem
	are discussed. Two new approaches to the problem are introduced.
	One approach is based on bid pricing, while the other approach is
	based stochastic dynamic programming. The second part of this thesis
	deals with extensions of existing and of the new approaches to deal
	with origin-destination (O/D) specific demand. O/D specific demand
	occurs in the context of air cargo and passengers who look for the
	cheapest itinerary that satisfies their needs. A specialized routing
	algorithm that utilizes the spoke-hub-structure of flight networks
	is given. The use of the routing algorithm in conjunction with the
	different YM approaches is discussed. Simulation studies are conducted
	to evaluate the different approaches to the passenger and cargo problems.
	Data provided by a major domestic carrier are used to construct realistic
	problems. The simulation results reveal revenue increases of up to
	8\% for the traditional passenger problem and up to 28\% for the
	cargo YM problem with O/D specific demand.}},

	It first shows that standard shortest path algorithms (such as the

	minimum path. Next, this paper shows that the optimal "route choice"

	from any given node to the final destination depends on the arrival
	time at that node. Because the arrival time is not known before departing
	the origin, a better route can be selected by deferring the final
	choice until later nodes are reached. A method for finding the optimal

	obtained from other hazmat objectives, on a numerical example as well
	as a hazmat routing scenario
	
	derived from the Albany district of New York State. Depending on the

	the VaR model gives different paths from which we conclude that the

	Abstract = {{This book deals with decision making in environments of significant
	data uncertainty, with particular emphasis on operations and production
	management applications. For such environments, we suggest the use
	of the robustness approach to decision making, which assumes inadequate
	knowledge of the decision maker about the random state of nature
	and develops a decision that hedges against the worst contingency
	that may arise. Robust Discrete Optimization is a comprehensive mathematical
	programming framework for robust decision making. This book takes
	a giant first step in presenting decision support tools and solution
	methods for generating robust decisions in a variety of interesting
	application environments such as: linear programming, assignment
	problems, shortest paths, minimum spanning trees, knapsack problems,
	resource allocation, scheduling, production planning, location, inventory,
	layout planning, network design, and international sourcing. Beyond
	theoretical results, the book provides many suggestions and useful
	advice to the practitioners of the robustness approach. Emphasis
	is placed upon the assessment of the decision environment for applicability
	of the approach, structuring of data uncertainty and the scenario
	generation process, choice of appropriate robustness criteria, and
	formulation and solution of robust decision problems. Audience: The
	book will be of interest to researchers, practitioners and graduate

	Abstract = {{This paper suggests two new heuristic algorithms for optimization
	of Value-at-Risk (VaR). By definition, VaR is an estimate of the
	maximum portfolio loss during a standardized period with some confidencelevel.
	The optimization algorithms are based on the minimization of the
	closely related risk measure Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR). For
	continuous distributions, CVaR is the expected loss exceeding VaR,
	and is also known as Mean Excess Loss or Expected Shortfall. For
	discrete distributions, CVaR is the weighted average of VaR and losses
	exceeding VaR. CVaR is an upper bound for VaR, therefore, minimization
	of CVaR also reduces VaR. The algorithms are tested by minimizing
	the credit risk of a portfolio of emerging market bonds. Numerical
	experiments showed that the algorithms are efficient and can handle
	a large number of instruments and scenarios. However, calculations
	identified a deficiency of VaR risk measure, compared to CVaR. Minimization
	of VaR leads to an undesirable stretch of the tail of the distribution
	exceeding VaR. For portfolios with skewed distributions, such as
	credit risk, minimization of VaR may result in a significant increase
	of high losses exceedingVaR. For the credit risk problem studied
	in this paper, VaR minimization leads to about 16\% increase of the
	average loss for the worst 1\% scenarios (compared to the worst 1\%
	scenarios in CVaR minimum solution). 1\% includes 200 of 20000 scenarios,
	which were used for estimating credit risk in this case study.}},

	Abstract = {This paper introduces a new methodology based on risk analysis for
	the selection of the best
	
	route for the transport of a hazardous substance. In order to perform
	this optimisation, the network
	
	is considered as a graph composed by nodes and arcs; each arc is assigned
	a cost per unit vehicle
	
	travelling on it and a vehicle capacity. After short discussion about
	risk measures suitable for
	
	linear risk sources, the arc capacities are introduced by comparison
	between the societal and
	
	individual risk measures of each arc with hazardous materials transportation
	risk criteria; then arc
	
	costs are defined in order to take into account both transportation
	out-of-pocket expenses and
	
	risk-related costs. The optimisation problem can thus be formulated
	as a {\"e}minimum cost flow
	
	problem{\'\i}, which consists of determining for a specific hazardous
	substance the cheapest flow
	
	distribution, honouring the arc capacities, from the origin nodes
	to the destination nodes. The main
	
	features of the optimisation procedure, implemented on the computer
	code OPTIPATH, are
	
	presented. Test results about shipments of ammonia are discussed and
	finally further research
	
	developments are proposed.},

	Abstract = {{The diffusion of the internet has substantially modified the advertising
	industry's business models. The method of selling advertising space
	on webpages is one of the most striking innovations. Advertisements
	and, in particular, banners, are sold through the traditional cost
	per impression, but also with methods based on a visitor taking some
	specifically defined action in response to an ad. This paper examines
	the pricing strategy of web publishers operating in a market where
	they are unable to influence the price of the advertisement (cost-per-impression
	and cost-per-action). The main finding is that the distribution of
	editorial revenues between pay-per-view and pay-per-click methods
	depends on the elasticity of access and actions with respect to the
	quantity of advertising. The theoretical result is important, since
	these parameters are usually available to permit a quick analysis
	of an online consumer's behaviour.Journal of Revenue \&\#38; Pricing

	Abstract = {{We consider stochastic, time-varying transportation networks, where
	the arc weights (arc travel times) are random variables with probability
	distribution functions that vary with time. Efficient procedures
	are widely available for determining least time paths in deterministic
	networks. In stochastic but time-invariant networks, least expected
	time paths can be determined by setting each random arc weight to
	its expected value and solving an equivalent deterministic problem.
	This paper addresses the problem of determining least expected time
	paths in stochastic, time-varying networks. Two procedures are presented.
	The first procedure determines the a priori least expected time paths
	from all origins to a single destination for each departure time
	in the peak period. The second procedure determines lower bounds
	on the expected times of these a priori least expected time paths.
	This procedure determines an exact solution for the problem where
	the driver is permitted to react to revealed travel times on traveled
	links en route, i.e., in a time-adaptive route choice framework.
	Modifications to each of these procedures for determining least expected
	cost (where cost is not necessarily travel time) paths and lower
	bounds on the expected costs of these paths are given. Extensive
	numerical tests are conducted to illustrate the algorithms' computational

	Abstract = {{For the Internet advertisement market, we consider a contract problem
	between advertisers and publishers. Among several ways of pricing
	online advertisements, the methods based on cost-per-impression (CPM)
	and cost-per-click (CPC) are the two most popular. The CPC fee is
	proportional to the click-through rate (CTR), which is uncertain
	and makes decisions of advertisers and publishers difficult. In this
	paper, we suggest a hybrid pricing scheme: advertisers pay the minimum
	of CPM and CPC fees by purchasing an option from publishers. To determine
	the option price, we consider a Nash bargaining game for negotiation
	between an advertiser and a publisher and provide the solution. Further,
	we show that such option contracts will help the advertiser avoid
	high cost and the publisher generate more revenue. The option contract
	will also improve the contract feasibility, compared to CPM and CPC.}},

	supply chain management. Special emphasis is placed on two important
	aspects of cooperative games: profit allocation and stability. The
	paper first describes the construction of the set of feasible outcomes
	in commonly seen supply chain models, and then uses cooperative bargaining
	models to find allocations of the profit pie between supply chain
	partners. In doing so, several models are analyzed and surveyed,
	and include suppliers selling to competing retailers, and assemblers
	negotiating with component manufacturers selling complementary components.
	The second part of the paper discusses the issue of coalition formation
	among supply chain partners. An exhaustive survey of commonly used
	stability concepts is presented. Further, new ideas such as farsightedness
	among supply chain players are also discussed and analyzed. The paper
	also opens some avenues of future research in applying cooperative

	Abstract = {{Abstract‚{\"A}{\^\i}The portfolio optimization problem is modeled
	as a mean-risk bicriteria optimization problem where the expected
	return is maximized and some (scalar) risk measure is minimized.
	In the original Markowitz model the risk is measured by the variance
	while several polyhedral risk measures have been introduced leading
	to Linear Programming (LP) computable portfolio optimization models
	in the case of discrete random variables represented by their realizations
	under specified scenarios. Among them, the second order quantile
	risk measures, recently, become popular in finance and banking. The
	simplest such measure, now commonly called the Conditional Value
	at Risk (CVaR) or Tail VaR, represents the mean shortfall at a specified
	confidence level. Recently, the second order quantile risk measures
	have been introduced and become popular in finance and banking. The
	corresponding portfolio optimization models can be solved with general
	purpose LP solvers. However, in the case of more advanced simulation
	models employed for scenario generation one may get several thousands
	of scenarios. This may lead to the LP model with huge number of variables
	and constraints thus decreasing the computational efficiency of the
	model since the number of constraints (matrix rows) is usually proportional
	to the number of scenarios. while the number of variables (matrix
	columns) is proportional to the total of the number of scenarios
	and the number of instruments. We show that the computational efficiency
	can be then dramatically improved with an alternative model taking
	advantages of the LP duality. In the introduced models the number
	of structural constraints (matrix rows) is proportional to the number
	of instruments thus not affecting seriously the simplex method efficiency
	by the number of scenarios.}},

	of financial risk across industry segments and market participants,
	is discrete by nature measuring the probability of worst case portfolio
	performance. In this paper I present four model frameworks that apply
	VaR to ex ante portfolio decisions. The mean-variance model, Young's
	(1998) minimax model and Hiller and Eckstein's (1993) stochastic
	programming model are extended to incorporate VaR. A fourth model,
	that is new, implements stochastic programming with a return aggregation
	technique. Performance tests are conducted on the four models using
	empirical and simulated data. The new model most closely matches
	the discrete nature of VaR exhibiting statistically superior performance
	across the series of tests. Robustness tests of the four model forms
	provides support for the argument that VaR-based investment strategies
	lead to higher risk decision than those where the severity of worst
	case performance is also considered.}},

	of robust optimization are used for the minimization of the conditional

@article{Talluri1998,
	Abstract = {{Bid-prices are becoming an increasingly popular method for controlling
	the sale of inventory in revenue management applications. In this
	form of control, threshold--or "bid"--prices are set for the resources
	or units of inventory (seats on flight legs, hotel rooms on specific
	dates, etc.) and a product (a seat in a fare class on an itinerary
	or room for a sequence of dates) is sold only if the offered fare
	exceeds the sum of the threshold prices of all the resources needed
	to supply the product. This approach is appealing on intuitive and
	practical grounds, but the theory underlying it is not well developed.
	Moreover, the extent to which bid-price controls represent optimal
	or near optimal policies is not well understood. Using a general
	model of the demand process, we show that bid-price control is not
	optimal in general and analyze why bid-price schemes can fail to
	produce correct accept/deny decisions. However, we prove that when
	leg capacities and sales volumes are large, bid-price controls are
	asymptotically optimal, provided the right bid prices are used. We
	also provide analytical upper bounds on the optimal revenue. In addition,
	we analyze properties of the asymptotically optimal bid prices. For
	example, we show they are constant over time, even when demand is
	nonstationary, and that they may not be unique.}},

@article{Yu1998,
	Abstract = {{The shortest path problem is of great importance to the real world
	in such areas as transportation, network design, telecommunication,
	etc. The deterministic version of the problem is easily solved. However,
	in the real world, uncertainty is frequently encountered and must
	be dealt with. For instance, in a transportation network, the path
	that has the least travel time when no traffic is present might be
	prone to accidents and traffic jams, and thus it may lead to a drastic
	increase in travel time during rush hours. In situations with significant
	uncertainty, the deterministic approach can be far from sufficient.
	New and appropriate criteria and models to handle uncertainties along
	with efficient solution techniques are in need. In this paper, we
	take a minimax approach to measure the performance under uncertainties.
	Under our measure, one path is superior to all others only if its
	worst case performance is better than that of the others. The complexity
	of the defined models, exact and heuristic solution methods are explored
	and presented. Analysis is done to examine the performance of the
	heuristic method. The shortest path (SP) problem in a network with
	nonnegative arc lengths can be solved easily by Dijkstra's labeling
	algorithm in polynomial time. In the case of significant uncertainty
	of the arc lengths, a robustness approach is more appropriate. In
	this paper, we study the SP problem under arc length uncertainties.
	A scenario approach is adopted to characterize uncertainties. Two
	robustness criteria are specified: the absolute robust criterion
	and the robust deviation criterion. We show that under both criteria
	the robust SP problem is NP-complete even for the much more restricted
	layered networks of width 2, and with only 2 scenarios. A pseudo-polynomial
	algorithm is devised to solve the robust SP problem in general networks
	under bounded number of scenarios. Also presented is a more efficient
	algorithm for layered networks. However, in the case of unlimited
	number of scenarios, we show that the robust SP problem is strongly
	NP-hard. A simple heuristic for finding a good robust shortest path
	is provided, and the worst case performance is analyzed.}},

	Abstract = {{Abstract: Portfolio optimization problems involving Value-at-Risk
	(VaR) are often computationally intractable and require complete
	information about the return distribution of the portfolio constituents,
	which is rarely available in practice. These difficulties are further
	compounded when the portfolio contains derivatives. We develop two
	tractable conservative approximations for the VaR of a derivative
	portfolio by evaluating the worst-case VaR over all return distributions
	of the derivative underliers with given first-and second-order moments.
	The derivative returns are modelled as convex piecewise linear or
	-- by using a delta-gamma approximation -- as (possibly non-convex)
	quadratic functions of the returns of the derivative underliers.
	These models lead to new Worst-Case Polyhedral VaR (WCPVaR) and Worst-Case
	Quadratic VaR (WCQVaR) approximations, respectively. WCPVaR is a
	suitable VaR approximation for portfolios containing long positions
	in European options expiring at the end of the investment horizon,
	whereas WCQVaR is suitable for portfolios containing long and/or
	short positions in European and/or exotic options expiring beyond
	the investment horizon. We prove that WCPVaR and WCQVaR optimization
	can be formulated as tractable second-order cone and semidefinite
	programs, respectively, and reveal interesting connections to robust
	portfolio optimization. Numerical experiments demonstrate the benefits
	of incorporating non-linear relationships between the asset returns

	Comment = {(private-note)Despite its popularity, VaR lacks some desirable theoretical properties. Firstly, VaR is known to be a non-convex risk measure. As a result, VaR optimization problems usually are computationally intractable. In fact, they belong to the class of chance-constrained stochastic programs, which are notoriously dicult to solve. Secondly, VaR fails to satisfy the subadditivity property of coherent risk measures [3]. Thus, the VaR of a portfolio can exceed the weighted sum of the VaRs of its constituents. In other words, VaR may penalize diversication. Thirdly, the computation of VaR requires precise knowledge of the joint probability distribution of the asset returns, which is rarely available in practice.},
